# fnd-oracle

These are simple basic packages that I use when I have to write a simple application in Oracle.<br>
The general idea is to install Oracle Express, install those packages and continue to create applications in PL/SQL.<br>
Those packages give me access to simple error handling, logger and other basic useful functions.
